        "choices": ["Vulnerable", "Endangered", "Endemic", "Extinct"],
        "answer": 2,
        "Explanation":"Endemic species are those species of plants and animals which are found exclusively in a particular area. They are not naturally found anywhere else. Endemic species are not included under red list because the red list contains those species whose continued existence is threatened. Each Red Data Book usually deals with a specific group of animals or plants (e.g., reptiles, insects, mosses)."

        "choices": ["exploitation of species", "use of biological control", "preservation of species", "use of biological fertilisers"],
        "answer": 2,
        "Explanation":"The creation of wildlife reserves and enforcement of laws are conservation measures that promote increased preservation of species. It is estimated that tropical forests are losing 2 – 5 species per hour or 14,000 – 40,000 species per year. If the current rate of species extinction goes on unabated, 50% of species are liable to die out by the end of the 21st century."

        "choices": ["Biodiversity equilibrium", "Flash floods", "Droughts", "Soil erosion"],
        "answer": 0,
        "Explanation":"Biodiversity equilibrium means maintaining a balance between the variety and variability of life on Earth which gets influenced by deforestation. Deforestation is a major cause which leads to the change in soil properties. Fewer trees result in more soil erosion. Removal of the top layer of the soil exposes the lower, hard and rocky layers. This soil has less humus and is less fertile. Gradually the fertile land gets converted into deserts. It is called desertification. It also leads to a decrease in the water-holding capacity of the soil. The movement of water from the soil surface into the ground is reduced. So, there are floods."

        "choices": ["Ozone layer", "Jet planes", "Methane", "Carbon dioxide"],
        "answer": 0,
        "Explanation":"Ozone layer acts as a shield which absorbs the harmful UV rays from the sun and is found in the stratosphere.        ∙ Global warming is a phenomenon of climate change which is characterised by an increase in the average temperature of the Earth. It is directly linked to the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere."

        "text": "Excessive combustion of fossil fuels leads to __",
        "choices": ["Deforestation", "volcanic eruptions", "global warming", "earthquakes"],
        "answer": 2,
        "Explanation":"Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour, etc.) trap the sun’s heat inside the atmosphere. The percentage of these gases increases in our atmosphere due to excessive usage of fossil fuels and this leads to an enhanced greenhouse effect. This is the main cause of global warming and climate change."

        "choices": ["Soil erosion", "Average rise in surface temperature", "Melting of ice on the poles", "Rise in sea level"],
        "answer": 0,
        "Explanation":"As the earth becomes hotter, the ice will melt on the poles and which will result in sea-level rise. Moreover, as the earth becomes hotter, it will make forests dry and more susceptible to forest fires. But global warming has no effect on soil and its fertility."

        "choices": ["A, B and C", "B and C", "A and B", "A only"],
        "answer": 0,
        "Explanation":"During heavy rain, trees absorb and store a large amount of water with the help of their roots thus preventing the top fertile soil from being eroded and acting as a barrier to floodwater, preventing soil erosion and floods. Similarly, cutting down trees for agriculture or for setting up buildings destroys the natural habitat of animals, sometimes leading to their deaths."
