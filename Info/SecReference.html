In conclusion, open-source tools play a crucial role in the field of cybersecurity, offering a wide range of solutions for different categories such as Software Composition Analysis (SCA), Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Container Security, and Infrastructure Security. These tools provide valuable support in identifying vulnerabilities, assessing security risks, and ensuring compliance.

However, it’s important to note that the landscape of open-source tools is dynamic, and the availability and popularity of specific tools may change over time. Open-source projects rely on community feedback and contributions for maintenance and updates, which means that their support can vary based on community involvement.

Ultimately, while open-source tools offer valuable resources and cost-effective solutions for cybersecurity, it is important to approach their selection and usage with a thorough understanding of their limitations and dependencies on community support.

AD:
Golden Ticket Attack

A Golden Ticket attack allows attackers to exploit the Kerberos protocol and impersonate any account on the AD by forging a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). By compromising the krbtgt account and using its password hash, the attackers gain complete control over the domain for as long as the forged ticket remains valid. The attack requires four critical pieces of information to be successful:

Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the domain
SID of the domain
Username of an account to impersonate
KRBTGT account password hash
Detection for this type of attack involves monitoring for unusual activity involving the krbtgt

Event ID 4768: Look for TGT requests for high-privilege accounts.
Event ID 4672: This logs when special privileges (such as SeTcbPrivilege) are assigned to a user
Reviewing Group Policy Objects (GPOs) is a great investigation step. In this section, we will use PowerShell to audit our GPOs.
Get-GPO -All
 Get-GPOReport -Name "SetWallpaper" -ReportType HTML -Path ".\SetWallpaper.html"    
 Get-GPO -All | Where-Object { $_.ModificationTime } | Select-Object DisplayName, ModificationTime ->Lists modified GPO's
 Event ID	Description
4624	A user account has logged on
4625	A user account failed to log on
4672	Special privileges (i.e. SeTcbPrivilege) have been assigned to a user
4768	A TGT (Kerberos) ticket was requested for a high-privileged account
To view all locked accounts, you can use the Search-ADAccount cmdlet, applying some filters to show information such as the last time the user had successfully logged in.

Search-ADAccount -LockedOut | Select-Object Name, SamAccountName, LockedOut, LastLogonDate, DistinguishedName
Additionally, a great way to quickly review the user accounts present on a domain, as well as their group membership, is by using the Get-ADUser
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties MemberOf | Select-Object Name, SamAccountName, @{Name="Groups";Expression={$_.MemberOf}}

On a Windows Server, this history file  is located at %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt.
Additionally, logs are recorded for every PowerShell process executed on a system. These logs are located within the Event Viewer under 
Application and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> PowerShell -> Operational or also under Application and Service Logs -> 
Windows PowerShell. The logs have a wealth of information useful for incident response.

Entra ID Enumeration
Using the current account, let's start by listing all the users in the tenant. 
az ad user list
The Azure CLI typically uses the following command syntax: az GROUP SUBGROUP ACTION OPTIONAL_PARAMETERS. Given this, the command above can be broken down into:

Target group or service: ad (Azure AD or Entra ID)
Target subgroup: user (Azure AD users)
Action: list
Note: To see the available commands, you may execute az -h or az GROUP -h.
az ad user list --filter "startsWith('wvusr-', displayName)"
az ad group list
 az account clear
 az login -u EMAIL -p PASSWORD
 az role assignment list --assignee REPLACE_WITH_SECRET_RECOVERY_GROUP_ID --all
 az keyvault list
 az keyvault secret list --vault-name warevillesecrets
  az keyvault secret show --vault-name warevillesecrets --name REDACTED .Replace the value of the --name parameter with the actual secret name
